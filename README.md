Goal:
To gauge your understanding of HTML, CSS basics and CSS Layouts.
Assignment:
Create your own "About Me" project. This will be a 3 page website, all pages should link together so
you can navigate in between the pages. The first page will be the profile page you worked on in the
previous assignment. Change and add styling so that it looks like a real web page. The second page
should be an image gallery laid out on the page in a grid formation. The third page can be whatever
you want to showcase more about you and any interests you want to display.
Hint: How will you show the user they can navigate to each page and back? Navigation is key!
Grading Criteria:
• HTML template is formatted correctly and all elements are indented/nested properly.
